# Wilson Gachunga

## About Me!

My name is Wilson Gachunga. I'm a senior at UNCG and a major in Computer Science with the Big Data and Data Science Concentration. I like distance running, baking, and reading. I love computer science because I love engineering creative solutions to unique problems, and improving my solutions with others. I am from the Raleigh area, but I've grown to appreciate the Triad as well.

## My CSC340 Goals

I want to learn how to make a web app and utilize more out of Java. I know the basic operations that were required for making Data Structures CSC330. I would also like to develop my collaboration skills and have better use of GitHub. I had little motivation to use proper documentation and nomenclature in personal projects. This class will hopefully allow me to better work with others and write cleaner, efficient code.
