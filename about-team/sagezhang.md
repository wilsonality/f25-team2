## About Me
I am a senior compsci student here at UNCG. Some of my favorite courses I have taken were Theory of Computation and Computer Organization & Assembly. I also love to cook and play RPGs!

## My CSC340 Goals
My goal for CSC340 is to learn about the industry, and finally start on my first "real" project.
