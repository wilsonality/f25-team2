## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Document Purpose
Spartan's List is an online marketplace dedicated to UNCG students and Almuni. Spartan's List aims to help students exchange goods and services, in order to better support fellow Spartans.

### 1.2 Product Scope
Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Explain what the product that is covered by this SRS will do, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem. 
Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.

TSpartan's List is a convenient and free web-based application to allow Spartans to post offers or shop for offers posted, these offers being goods or services. This is a web-based application as to permit account creation, offer postage and purchase, and account data tracking.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations

| Reference | Definition   |
| ---- | ------- | 
|   Java   |   An object oriented programming language developed in 1995 by James Gosling. This is the primary programming langauage that will be used to develop Spartan's List.      | 
|   PostgreSQL   | Open-source relational database management system. |
|   Spring MVC   | Model-View-Controller. This is the architectural pattern that will be used to implement the system. |
| Spring Web  |  This is used to build our web application with Spring MVC.  |
| API | Application programming interface. This will be used in the front-end and back-end of the system. |
| HTML | Hypertext Markup Language. This is the language used to structure the web pages of Spartan's List.|
| CSS | Cascading Style Sheets. This is used to add styling and appearances to the web application. |
|JavaScript| An object-oriented computer programming language  used to create interactive elements within web browsers. This will be used with HTML and CSS to make the application. |

### 1.4 References
List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.

### 1.5 Document Overview
Describe what the rest of the document contains and how it is organized.

## 2. Product Overview
### 2.1 Product Functions
Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

### 2.2 Product Constraints
* Spartan's List be hosted on a website.
* Spartan's List must be mobile friendly.
* Spartan's List must protect user's privacy.
  
### 2.3 User Characteristics
#### Shopper
* Views listings for sale
#### Seller
* Lists things for sale

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements 
This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

The specific requirements should:
* Be uniquely identifiable.
* State the subject of the requirement (e.g., system, software, etc.) and what shall be done.
* Optionally state the conditions and constraints, if any.
* Describe every input (stimulus) into the software system, every output (response) from the software system, and all functions performed by the software system in response to an input or in support of an output.
* Be verifiable (e.g., the requirement realization can be proven to the customer's satisfaction)
* Conform to agreed upon syntax, keywords, and terms.

#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

Could be further divided into Usability and Convenience requirements.

#### 3.1.2 Hardware interfaces
Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.

#### 3.1.3 Software interfaces
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

### 3.2 Non Functional Requirements 

#### 3.2.1 Performance
If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features.

#### 3.2.2 Security
Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.

#### 3.2.3 Reliability
Specify the factors required to establish the required reliability of the software system at time of delivery.

#### 3.2.4 Availability
Specify the factors required to guarantee a defined availability level for the entire system such as checkpoint, recovery, and restart.

#### 3.2.5 Compliance
Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations

#### 3.2.6 Cost
Specify monetary cost of the software product.

#### 3.2.7 Deadline
Specify schedule for delivery of the software product.
